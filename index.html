        <h1>Why Would I Want To Use This Annotation?</h1>

<p>I wrote this annotation to help me when working with legacy code. Much of the code I work with does not have associated unit tests, so its behavior is not well documented.
When adding functionality or changing an existing part of the system, I try to write as many unit tests as I can to document the behavior and to help ensure that I don't break existing functionality.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, the legacy code would all be correct and the unit tests would be an accurate description of the system's behavior.
Since I don't live in a perfect world, the reality is that quite often the legacy code contains bugs. By writing tests that document the behavior of the system, I am also writing tests that pass because of these bugs.
I don't want someone else to look at the tests as an accurate description of how the system works, especially if the behavior is dependent on defects.
The answer I went with was to create an annotation that can be added to (preferably test) methods to indicate that the behavior of the method is dependent on a known defect.</p>

<p>Here's an example from the code that prompted me to create this annotation:</p>

<pre><code>@Test(expected = InvalidRequestException.class)
public void testValidateNullResponse() {
    ProtocolParser.validateResponse(null);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This test documents the system as it currently exists, but the behavior is not correct. The <code>ProtocolParser</code> class should be throwing an <code>InvalidResponseException</code>, not an <code>InvalidRequestException</code>.
To document this defect, I add the following annotation to the test method:</p>

<p><code>@KnownDefect("Should throw InvalidResponseException")</code></p>

<p>The correct behavior is now documented, and the test still passes.</p>

<p>Portions of this code were written in front of a live studio audience.</p>
